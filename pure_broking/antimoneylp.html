                        implications of the Act. The Guidelines also sets out the steps that a registered intermediary and any of its representatives, should implement
                        to discourage and identify any money laundering or terrorist financing activities. The relevance and usefulness of these Guidelines will be kept
                        under review and it may be necessary to issue amendments from time to time.
                      </p>

                      <h2>Background</h2>
                      <p>
                        Money Laundering is the process by which large amounts of illegally obtained money (from drug trafficking, terrorist activity or other serious crimes)
                        is given the appearance of having originated from a legitimate source. All crimes that produce a financial benefit give rise to money laundering. The
                        Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 has come into effect from 1st July 2005. Necessary Notifications / Rules under the said Act have been published
                        in the Gazette of India on 1st July 2005 by the Department of Revenue, Ministry of Finance, and Government of India. The PMLA has been further amended
                        vide notification dated March 6, 2009 and inter alia provides that violating the prohibitions on manipulative and deceptive devices, insider trading and
                        substantial acquisition of securities or control as prescribed in Section 12 A read with Section 24 of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992
                        (SEBI Act) will now be treated as a scheduled offence under schedule B of the PMLA.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        As per the provisions of the Act, every banking company, financial institution (which includes chit Fund Company, a co-operative bank, a housing finance
                        Institution and a non-banking financial company) and intermediary (which includes a stock-broker, sub-broker, share transfer agent, banker to an issue,
                        trustee to a trust deed, registrar to an issue, merchant banker, underwriter, portfolio manager, investment adviser and any other intermediary associated
                        with securities market and registered under section 12 of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992) shall have to maintain a record of all the
                        transactions; the nature and value of which has been prescribed in the Rules under the PMLA. Such transactions include
                      </p>

                      <ul class="feature-list">
                        <li>
                            All cash transactions of the value of more than Rs 10 laces or its equivalent in foreign currency
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            All series of cash transactions integrally connected to each other which have been valued below Rs 10 laces or its equivalent in foreign currency
                            where such series of transactions take place within one calendar month.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            All suspicious transactions whether or not made in cash and including, inter-alia, credits or debits into from any non monetary account such as Demat
                            account, security
                        </li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>
                        It may, however, be clarified that for the purpose of suspicious transactions reporting, apart from 'transactions integrally connected', 'transactions
                        remotely connected or related' should also be considered
                      </p>
                      <p>

                            beneficially own or control securities account. Whenever it is apparent that the securities acquired or maintained through an account are beneficially
                            owned by a party other than the client, that party should be identified and verified using client identification and verification procedures as early
                            as possible. The beneficial owner is the natural person or persons who ultimately own, control, or influence a client and/or persons on whose behalf
                            a transaction(s) is/are being conducted. It includes persons who exercise ultimate effective control over a legal person or arrangement.

                        <strong>Identity Proof :</strong> PAN Card itself can serve as proof of identity. However, in case PAN card carries an old photograph of the holder,
                        which does not match current facial features of the client, we should take other identity proof in form of Voter's Identity card ,Passport, Ration

                        <strong>Address Proof :</strong> For valid address proof we can rely on Voter's Identity Card, Passport, Bank Statement, Aadhaar Letter, Ration card and
                        latest Electricity/telephone bill in the name of the client.

									classifying the clients, we will be in a better position to apply appropriate customer due diligence process. That is, for high risk client we have to
									apply higher degree of due diligence. The factors of risk perception depend on client’s KYC details, location, nature of business/trading activity,
