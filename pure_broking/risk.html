                        Segments of the stock exchanges. All prospective constituents should read this document
                        before trading in Equities/Derivatives Segments of the Exchanges.

                    <p>
                        In the light of the risks involved, you should undertake transactions only if you
                        understand the nature of the relationship into which you are entering and the extent

                        You must know and appreciate that trading in Equity shares, derivatives contracts
                        or other instruments traded on the Stock Exchange, which have varying element of
                        risk, is generally not an appropriate avenue for someone of limited resources/limited
                        investment and/or trading experience and low risk tolerance. You should therefore
                        carefully consider whether such trading is suitable for you in the light of your
                        financial condition. In case you trade on Stock exchanges and suffer adverse consequences
                        or 1055, you shall be solely responsible for the same and Stock exchanges/its Clearing

                        regarding the risks involved was made or that you were not explained the full risk
                        involved by the concerned stock broker. The constituent shall be solely responsible
                        for the consequences and no contract can be rescinded on that account. You must
                        acknowledge and accept that there can be no guarantee of profits or no exception
                        from losses while executing orders for purchase and/or sale of a derivative contract
                        being traded on Stock exchanges.

                    <h2>BASIC RISKS</h2>
                    <p class="b-heading mb-1">RISK OF HIGHER VOLATILITY</p>
                    <p class="mb-3">
                        Volatility refers to the dynamic changes in price that a security/derivatives contract undergoes when trading activity continues on the Stock Exchanges.
                        Generally, higher the· volatility of a security/derivatives contract, greater is its price swings. There may be normally greater volatility in thinly
                        traded securities / derivatives contracts than in active securities /derivatives contracts. As a result of volatility, your order may only be partially
                        executed or not executed at all, or the price at which your order got executed may be substantially different from the last traded price or change
                        substantially thereafter, resulting in notional or real losses
                    </p>
                    <p class="b-heading mb-1">RISK OF LOWER LIQUIDITY</p>
                    <p>
                        Liquidity refers to the ability of market participants to buy and/or sell securities / derivatives contracts expeditiously at a competitive price and with
                        minimal price difference. Generally, it is assumed that more the numbers of orders available in a market, greater is the liquidity. Liquidity is important
                        because with greater liquidity, it is easier for investors to buy and/or sell securities / derivatives contracts swiftly and with minimal price difference,
                        and as a result, investors are more likely to pay or receive a competitive price for securities / derivatives contracts purchased or sold. There may be a
                        risk of lower liquidity in some securities / derivatives contracts as compared to active securities / derivatives contracts. As a result, your order may
                        only be partially executed, or may be executed with relatively greater price difference or may not be executed at all.
                    </p>
                    <ul class="feature-list mb-3">
                        <li>
                            Buying or selling securities / derivatives contracts as part of a day trading strategy may also result into losses, because in such a situation,
                            securities / derivatives contracts may have to be sold / purchased at low / high prices, compared to the expected price levels, so as not to have
                            any open position or obligation to deliver or receive a security / derivatives contract.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p class="b-heading mb-1">RISK OF WIDER SPREADS</p>
                    <p class="mb-3">
                        Spread refers to the difference in best buy price and best sell price. It represents the differential between-the price of buying a security / derivatives
                        contract and immediately selling it or vice versa. Lower liquidity and higher volatility may result in wider than normal spread for less liquid or illiquid
                        securities / derivatives contract. This in turn will hamper better price information.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class="b-heading mb-1">RISK-REDUCING ORDERS</p>
                    <p>
                        The placing of orders (e.g., “stop loss” orders, or “limit” orders) which are intended to limit losses to certain amounts may not be effective many a time
                        because rapid movement in market conditions may make it impossible to execute such orders.
                    </p>
                    <ul class="feature-list mb-3">
                        <li>
                            “Market” order will be executed promptly, subject to availability of orders on opposite side, without regard 'to price and that, while the customer
                            may receive a prompt execution of a “market” order, the execution may be at available prices of outstanding orders, which satisfy the order quantity,
                            on price time priority. It may be understood that these prices may be significantly different from the last traded price or the best price in that
                            security / derivatives contract.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            “Limit” order will be executed only at the “limit” price specified for the order or a better price. However, while the customer receives price
                            protection, there is a possibility that the order may not be executed at all.                            
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            A stop loss order is generally placed “away” from the current price of a stock / derivatives contract, and such order gets activated if and when the
                            security / derivatives contract reaches, or trades through,· the stop price. Sell stop orders are entered ordinarily below the current price, and buy
                            stop orders are entered ordinarily above the current price. When the security / derivatives contract reaches the pre -determined price, or trades
                            through such price, the stop loss order converts to a market/limit order and is executed at the limit or better. There is no assurance therefore that
                            the limit order will be executable since a security / derivatives contract might penetrate the pre-determined price, in which case, the risk of such
                            order not getting executed arises, just as with a regular limit order
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="b-heading mb-1">RISK OF NEWS ANNOUNCEMENT</p>
                    <p class="mb-3">
                        News announcements that may impact the price of stock / derivatives contract may occur during trading, and when combined with lower liquidity and higher
                        volatility, may suddenly cause an unexpected positive or negative movement in the price of the security / contract.
                    </p>

                    <p class="b-heading mb-1">RISK OF RUMORS</p>
                    <p class="mb-3">
                        Rumors about companies / currencies at times float in the market through word of mouth, newspapers, websites or news agencies, etc. The investors
                        should be wary of and should desist from acting on rumors
                    </p>

                    <p class="b-heading mb-1">SYSTEM RISK</p>
                    <p>
                        High volume trading will frequently occur at the market opening and before market close. Such high volumes may also occur at any point in the day.
                        These may cause delays in order execution or confirmation.
                    </p>
                    <ul class="feature-list mb-3">
                        <li>

                        Trading on exchanges is in electronic mode, based on satellite/leased line based communications, combination of technologies and computer systems to place
                        and route orders. Thus, there exists a possibility of communication failure or system problems or slow or delayed response from system or trading halt,
                        or any such other problem/glitch whereby not being able to establish access to the trading system/network, which may be beyond control and may result in
                        delay in processing or not processing buy or sell orders either in part or in full. You are cautioned to note that although these problems may be temporary
                        in nature, but when you have outstanding open position or unexecuted order, these represent risk because of your obligation to settle all execution
                        transaction.

                    <h2>As far as Derivatives segments are concerned, Please note and get yourself acquainted with the following additional features :</h2>
                    
                    <p class="b-heading mb-1">EFFECT OF “LEVERAGE” OR “GEARING”</p>
                    <ul class="feature-list mb-3">
                        <li>
                            In the derivatives market, the amount of margin is small relative to the value of the derivatives contract so the transactions are 'leveraged' or
                            'geared'. Derivatives trading, which is conducted with a relatively small amount of margin, provides the possibility of great profit or loss in
                            comparison with the margin amount. But transactions in derivatives carry a high degree of risk.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            You should therefore completely understand the following statements before actually trading in derivatives and also trade with caution while taking
                            into account one's circumstances, financial resources, etc. If the prices move against you, you may lose a part of or whole margin amount in a
                            relatively short period of time. Moreover, the loss may exceed the original margin amount.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Futures trading involve daily settlement of all positions. Every day the open positions are marked to market based on the closing level of the
                            index / derivatives contract. If the contract has moved against you, you will be required to deposit the amount of loss (notional) resulting from
                            such movement. This amount will have to be paid within a stipulated time frame, generally before commencement of trading on next day.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If you fail to deposit the additional amount by the deadline or if an outstanding debt occurs in your account, the stock broker may liquidate a part
                            of or the whole position or substitute securities. In this case, you will be liable for any losses incurred due to such close-outs.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Under certain market conditions an investor may find it difficult or impossible to execute transactions. for example, this situation can occur due
                            to factors such as illiquidity i.e. when there are insufficient bid or offer or suspension on trading due to price limit or circuit breakers.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            In order to maintain market stability, the following step may be adopted: change in margin rate, increases in cash margin rate or others.
                            These new measure may also be applied to the existing open interest. in such conditions, you will be required to put up additional margin or
                            reduce your position.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            You must ask your broker to provide the full details of derivatives contracts you plan to trade i.e. the contract specifications and the associated
                            obligations.
                        </li>

                            affected by fluctuation in currency where there is need to convert from the currency denomination of the contract to another currency.

                            Under certain market condition, you may find it difficult or impossible to liquidate position. This can occur for example when a currency is

                            An option holder run the risk of losing the entire amount paid for the option in a relatively short period of time. This risk reflects the nature
                            of an option as wasting assets which become worthless when it expires. An option holder neither sells his option in secondary market nor exercises
                            it prior to its expiration will necessarily lose his entire investment in the option. If the price of the underlying does not change in anticipated

                    <ul class="feature-list mb-3">
                        <li>
                            If the price movement of the underlying is not in the anticipated direction, the option writer runs the risk of losing substantial amount.

                        <li>
                            The risk of being an option writer may be reduced by the purchase of other option on the same underlying interest and hereby assuming a spread
                            position or by acquiring other type of hedging position in the option market or other markets. However, even where the writer has assumed a spread
                            or other hedging position, the risk may still be significant. A spread position is not necessarily less risky than a simple 'long' or 'short' position

                            short the underlying interest, present additional risk to investors. Combination transaction such as option spreader are more complex than buying
                            or writing a single option and it should be further noted that, as in area of investing, a complexity not well understood is, in itself, a risk factor.
                            While this is not a suggest that combination strategy should not be considered, it is advisable, as is the case with all investment option, to
                            consult with someone who is experienced and knowledgeable with respect to the risks and potential rewards of combination transaction under various
                            market circumstances.
